## Election-Audit Summary
The Python script can be used for other election audits with small changes. For example, the script would have to be changed for which file to load. 

Examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections:

- The script could be changed to determine the how each county voted for each candidate. 
- Depending on the structure of data file, one could have to adjust the script variable names and output instructions.
